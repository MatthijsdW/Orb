# Orb
The start of a platforming crafting game, where more powerful equipment can be created from enemy and boss drops.
Currently only one weapon is implemented and no inventory or item systems yet.
I've done some experimentation with world generation and my own particle system for this game.

Controls are WASD to move, left mouse button to throw the orb, which generates mana pickups, and right button for a more powerful area effect attack, when the player has enough mana.
